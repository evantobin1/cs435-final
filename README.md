# BLE Data Exchange Project

## Project Overview

This project enables an Arduino device to act as a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) peripheral that can receive and send data to and from a BLE central device, such as a smartphone or tablet. It includes functionality to receive data over BLE, store it in a buffer, and process this data as required by the application. Additionally, the project supports sending data back to the central device and receiving write events from it.

## Hardware Setup

### Requirements

- Arduino Nano 33 BLE or compatible board
- BLE central device (e.g., smartphone with BLE support)
- (Optional) External components for specific application needs (e.g., sensors, LEDs)
